In doing so, we will consider not only musicians who first emerged as leaders during this period (Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, Wynton Marsalis, John Scofield), but also those whose careers began earlier (Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Gil Evans) and continued into the 1950s and beyond. We will also examine how repertoire from previous historical periods came to be viewed by subsequent generations.

In doing so, we will consider not only musicians who first emerged as leaders during this period (Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, Wynton Marsalis, John Scofield), but also those whose careers began earlier (Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Gil Evans) and continued into the 1950s and beyond.

In doing so, we will consider not only musicians who first emerged as leaders during this period (Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, Wynton Marsalis, John Scofield), but also those whose careers began earlier (Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Gil Evans) and continued into the 1950s and beyond. We will also examine how repertoire from previous historical periods came to be viewed by subsequent generations.

The class will be intimately tied to the April 11, 2014 Humanities Project sponsored conference, \"The Trouble with Post-Blackness,\" which will bring twenty distinguished writers and critics to discuss the challenges of post-blackness. Students will be expected to attend the conference.

In doing so, we will consider not only musicians who first emerged as leaders during this period (Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, Wynton Marsalis, John Scofield), but also those whose careers began earlier (Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Gil Evans) and continued into the 1950s and beyond. We will also examine how repertoire from previous historical periods came to be viewed by subsequent generations.

In doing so, we will consider not only musicians who first emerged as leaders during this period (Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, Wynton Marsalis, John Scofield), but also those whose careers began earlier (Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Gil Evans) and continued into the 1950s and beyond. We will also examine how repertoire from previous historical periods came to be viewed by subsequent generations. The instructional format includes lectures and discussion along with in-class viewings/listenings of recorded performances.
