In doing so, we will consider not only musicians who first emerged as leaders during this period (Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, Wynton Marsalis, John Scofield), but also those whose careers began earlier (Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Gil Evans) and continued into the 1950s and beyond. We will also examine how repertoire from previous historical periods came to be viewed by subsequent generations.

In doing so, we will consider not only musicians who first emerged as leaders during this period (Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, Wynton Marsalis, John Scofield), but also those whose careers began earlier (Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Gil Evans) and continued into the 1950s and beyond.
